// JavaScript

// JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.
// It was invented by Brendan Eich.

// Basic JavaScript:

// JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, enabling dynamic changes to web pages without requiring a page reload.
// It is a high-level, interpreted language, meaning it's human-readable and doesn't require compilation before execution.
// JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing variable types to be determined at runtime.
// It is event-driven, enabling developers to respond to user actions like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.
// JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it cross-platform compatible and widely accessible.
// It supports object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing for the creation of reusable code through objects and classes.

// Advantages of JavaScript:

// Enhanced User Experience: JavaScript enables interactive and dynamic web experiences, improving user engagement and satisfaction.
// Versatility: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple DOM manipulation to complex web applications and games.
// Reduced Server Load: By offloading tasks to the client-side, JavaScript can reduce the burden on servers, leading to faster and more scalable web applications.
// Extensive Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, making it easy for developers to build and maintain complex web applications.

// Server-Side JavaScript:

// JavaScript can also be used on the server-side. Node.js is a popular runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on servers, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.
// Current version of JavaScript: ECMAScript 2022.

// Frameworks and Libraries:

// JavaScript has numerous frameworks and libraries that simplify web development and provide additional functionality.
// Some popular ones include:
// React (Current version: 18.0.0)
// Angular (Current version: 13.0.0)
// Vue.js (Current version: 3.2.14)
// Express.js (Current version: 4.17.1)
// jQuery (Current version: 3.6.0)
// Node.js (Current version: 16.13.0)
// These frameworks and libraries help streamline development, improve code quality, and accelerate the creation of web applications.
